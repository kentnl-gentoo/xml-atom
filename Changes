Revision history for XML::Atom

0.03  2003.12.05
    - Added XML::Atom::Author to represent author or contributor, with
      accessors for name, email, URL, etc.
    - Updated XML::Atom::API per the 08 API spec:
          * Removed searchEntries and replaced it with getFeed
          * Removed introspection and replaced it with URI parameters
            to createEntry and getFeed (introspection will be added
            back in once it is more locked down)
    - Added support for easily adding <link> tags to feed or entry
      (eg XML::Atom::Feed::add_link) and getting <link> tags from feed or
      entry (eg XML::Atom::Feed::get_links).
    - Fixed XML::Atom::Thing::get to return undef when an element is
      not found in the object at all (it used to return the empty string).

0.02  2003.09.28
    - Completely revamped authentication mechanism to use X-WSSE header
      (or corresponding SOAP headers).
    - Removed 03-client.t test, because there aren't any publicly
      available servers to test against. (Are there?)
    - Added support for SOAP wrapper in API client.
    - Added namespace support in XML::Atom::Namespace using get and set
      methods in XML::Atom::Entry and XML::Atom::Feed.
    - Added namespace normalization for produced XML (if XML::LibXSLT
      is installed). This is really just a cosmetic thing.

0.01  2003.09.07
    - Initial distribution.
